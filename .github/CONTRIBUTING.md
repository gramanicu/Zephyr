# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this. It means I got your attention :)

## Testing

The application was a test, learning app pretty much, so bugs do exist. But I would like to improve the appliction. So, if you test the app and find something, please let me know.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading my code and you'll get the hang of it. Or not. I tried to optimize it for readability, but it's not that easy sometimes:

  * I indent using two spaces (soft tabs) 
  * I ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows. I let Visual Studio do pretty much all the work.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
